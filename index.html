        <h3 class="mt-4">What is this?</h3>
        <p>If you ended up here, you were probably looking at some links that I share around. Well, this is my mini-domain that I use to host random things. For example, images that I upload with my screenshot program get uploaded to this domain or asset files I use on other pages. This is kind of like my dump server where everything gets thrown in for me to use alongside my other projects or for fun.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">Can I use the files here?</h3>
        <p>Uhh, it kind of depends what you're using. I'd recommend not using the asset files found in cdn.mkn.cx because many of them have licenses tied to them. If you use them without a valid license you could risk falling into trouble. Things found on u.mkn.cx feel free to download and use if it's just a random screenshot, but leave credit! If you ever have doubts you can contact me at <a href="https://makan.bz">my website</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-3">Am I able to upload too?</h3>
        <p>Not yet chief, but hey, it's an idea for the future! For the meantime, you can have this cat.</p>
